                AIGS (AI Gateway Suite) is a comprehensive, locally runnable AI platform that combines a modern React
                frontend with a robust ASP.NET Core backend, seamlessly integrating with LM Studio for local AI
                inference.

            <!-- What is AIGS -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>What is AIGS?</h2>
                <p>
                    In an era where artificial intelligence is transforming how we work and interact with technology,
                    most AI solutions require sending your data to third-party cloud services. AIGS takes a different
                    approach: it's a complete AI gateway solution designed for <strong>local-first deployments</strong>,
                    meaning your data never leaves your infrastructure. Whether you're a privacy-conscious individual,
                    a company with strict data governance requirements, or simply someone who wants to experiment with
                    AI without recurring cloud costs, AIGS provides everything you need to run a production-grade AI
                    chat system entirely on your own hardware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of AIGS as your personal ChatGPT, but one that respects your privacy, runs on your machine,
                    and gives you complete control over your conversations and data. It provides a full-featured chat
                    interface with all the modern conveniences you'd expect: real-time streaming responses, organized
                    conversation management, collaborative features like conversation sharing, and enterprise-grade
                    security including user authentication, role-based access control, and optional end-to-end
                    encryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its core, AIGS integrates seamlessly with LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible API. This means you can
                    run powerful open-source language models (like Llama, Mistral, or any model supported by LM Studio)
                    directly on your laptop or server, and interact with them through a polished web interface that
                    feels just as professional as any commercial offering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project offers two deployment modes to fit different use cases, from quick personal setups to
                    enterprise-scale deployments:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SimpleGateway</strong> - A monolithic, all-in-one application that combines the entire
                        stack into a single executable. Perfect for quick deployments, local development, and scenarios
                        where simplicity and ease of use trump architectural complexity. You can have AIGS up and
                        running in under 5 minutes with just a few shell commands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layered Architecture</strong> - A clean architecture implementation with separate Api,
                        Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers. This approach follows enterprise best practices
                        and is ideal when you need testability, scalability, team collaboration, or plan to customize
                        and extend the system significantly. Each layer is independent and can be tested, modified, or
                        even swapped out without affecting the others.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    What truly sets AIGS apart is its completeness. This isn't just a proof-of-concept or a minimal
                    example - it's a full-featured platform with user management, conversation organization, chat
                    templates, audit logging, webhook integrations, automated backups, and comprehensive monitoring. You
                    get all the polish and features of a commercial SaaS product, but running entirely under your
                    control.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Key Features -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                <p>
                    AIGS isn't just another chat interface - it's a comprehensive platform that brings together
                    everything you need for professional AI deployments. From the moment you start your first
                    conversation, you'll notice the attention to detail: streaming responses that appear character-by-
                    character just like commercial services, conversation organization that scales from a handful to
                    thousands of chats, and a security model robust enough for enterprise use yet simple enough for
                    personal projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's explore what makes AIGS a complete solution. Each feature has been designed not just to work,
                    but to work well - with edge cases handled, errors caught gracefully, and user experience polished.
                    Whether you're a solo developer running AIGS on your laptop or an organization deploying it for
                    your team, these features provide the foundation for serious AI work:

            <!-- Quick Start -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Quick Start</h2>
                <p>
                    Getting started with AIGS is designed to be as frictionless as possible. We understand that setting
                    up a complex AI environment can often be a headache of dependencies and configurations. That's why
                    we've streamlined the process into two distinct paths. Whether you just want to try it out in a few
                    minutes or you're setting up a robust development environment, we have a path for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you begin, you'll need a few standard tools installed. These are the foundational building
                    blocks that AIGS relies on to run efficiently on your local machine:
                </p>

                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>.NET 8 SDK</strong> - The runtime for our high-performance backend. <a
                            href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download" target="_blank">Download here</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Node.js 18+</strong> - Required to build and run the modern React frontend. <a
                            href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Download here</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>LM Studio</strong> - The engine behind the AI. This needs to be running locally on
                        <code>http://127.0.0.1:1234</code> to provide the intelligence for the chat.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Caddy</strong> (optional) - A powerful, automatic HTTPS server that acts as a reverse
                        proxy, simplifying how you access the application.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Option A: SimpleGateway (Recommended for Quick Start)</h3>
                <p>
                    If you want to see AIGS in action immediately, the SimpleGateway mode is your best friend. It
                    abstracts away the complexity of running separate frontend and backend processes. By using our
                    convenience scripts, you can pull the code, configure the environment, and launch the entire suite
                    with minimal effort. This is the ideal starting point for most users.
                </p>

                <pre><code># 1. Clone the repository
git clone &lt;your-repo-url&gt;
cd AI_Interface

# 2. Run setup script (installs/configures Caddy)
./setup-local.sh

# 3. Start the application
./start-simple.sh

# 4. Open your browser
# Frontend: http://localhost
# API: http://localhost/api</code></pre>

                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <strong>Default Login:</strong> Use username <code>admin</code> and password <code>admin</code> for
                    your first login. Change this immediately in production!
                </div>

                <p>To stop the application:</p>
                <pre><code>./stop-simple.sh</code></pre>

                <p>Check status:</p>
                <pre><code>./status.sh</code></pre>

                <h3>Option B: Layered Stack (Development Mode)</h3>
                <p>For development with hot reload:</p>

                <pre><code># 1. Start the backend API</ code>
cd src/Gateway.Api
dotnet run --urls="http://localhost:5000"

# 2. In a new terminal, start the frontend
cd src/WebApp
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:5173
# API will be at: http://localhost:5000</code></pre>

                <div class="alert alert-warning">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> In development mode, you'll need to ensure CORS is configured correctly in
                    <code>appsettings.json</code> to allow requests from localhost:5173.
                </div>

            <!-- Technology Stack -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
                <p>
                    AIGS is built on a foundation of modern, battle-tested technologies. We didn't just pick the newest
                    hype; we chose tools that offer the best balance of performance, developer experience, and long-term
                    maintainability. The architecture couples a high-performance ASP.NET Core backend with a reactive,
                    type-safe React frontend, ensuring the application feels snappy and robust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every component in the stack serves a specific purpose in delivering a premium local AI experience.
                    From the database layer up to the UI styling, here is a breakdown of the technologies that power
                    AIGS and why we chose them:

            <!-- Deployment Modes -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Deployment Modes</h2>
                <p>
                    One size rarely fits all in software deployment. That's why AIGS is designed with flexibility in
                    mind. Depending on your needs—whether you're hacking on a new feature over the weekend or deploying
                    a stable tool for your team—you can choose the deployment model that makes the most sense for you.
                    Both modes share the same core DNA but package it differently.
                </p>

                <h3>SimpleGateway (Monolithic)</h3>
                <p>
                    The SimpleGateway mode is all about reducing friction. It bundles the frontend, backend, and
                    database
                    management into a single, cohesive unit. This approach minimizes the "moving parts" you need to
                    manage, making it incredibly easy to deploy on a single machine or distribute to users who might not
                    be technical experts.
                </p>
                <div class="card">
                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Quick deployments, local development, demos, single-user setups</p>
                    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Single executable with all layers combined</li>
                        <li>Built-in EF Core migrations</li>
                        <li>SQLite database by default</li>
                        <li>Admin tools and backup services included</li>
                        <li>Easy to deploy with included scripts</li>
                        <li>Perfect for air-gapped or offline environments</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Use when:</strong> You need a quick setup, are running locally, or prefer simplicity over
                        separation of concerns.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Layered Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    For scenarios demanding more rigor, the Layered Architecture mode shines. It strictly enforces
                    separation
                    of concerns, ensuring that your business logic, API endpoints, and infrastructure code remain
                    distinct.
                    This is the preferred mode for active development and enterprise environments, as it facilitates
                    easier
                    testing, cleaner code organization, and independent scaling of components.
                </p>
                <div class="card">
                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Team deployments, production environments, scalability, testability
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clear separation: Api → Application → Domain → Infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Dependency Injection throughout</li>
                        <li>Easy to test individual layers</li>
                        <li>Supports horizontal scaling</li>
                        <li>Clean architecture principles</li>
                        <li>Can swap database/integrations easily</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Use when:</strong> You need enterprise-grade architecture, plan to scale, have a team, or
                        require extensive testing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <strong>Tip:</strong> Start with SimpleGateway for proof-of-concept, then migrate to the layered
                    architecture when you need more structure or scalability.
